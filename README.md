# Brainwave-Matrix-Solutions
# 🗓️ Day Planner Web Application

A responsive and user-friendly daily planner web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Designed to help users efficiently organize their tasks during standard working hours (9 AM – 5 PM). Tasks are stored locally using the browser's `localStorage` API, ensuring persistence between sessions without a backend.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This application dynamically generates time blocks for each hour of the workday. Users can enter, save, and retrieve tasks, which are color-coded based on the current time to indicate whether the task is in the past, present, or future.

Developed as part of a practical project for **Brainwave Matrix Solutions** to demonstrate front-end development skills and understanding of DOM manipulation, responsive design, and client-side storage.
